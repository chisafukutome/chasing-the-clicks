1. LEVEL 1 CHALLENGE

Chasing the Clicks

Build a web page (or any kind of hosted web app) with a clickable button and a click count. Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number should reflect all previous clicks. That means, refreshing the page should not reset the count to 0 or any other default number.

You can earn bonus points for showing on the web page the distribution of clicks by geography. This could be a simple table, a map or any other way that you can think of.
